# Software

The CoReACTER develops software as part of our scholarly work! All code is open source (currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CoReACTER)), in line with our commitment to [open science](/philosophy/openscience.md). Contributions from external developers are always welcome; please feel free to report issues and submit pull requests!

Here, we list only packages that were initially or are primarily developed by the CoReACTER. However, we note that ReACTERs contribute to many other community codes!

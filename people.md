## Graduate Students

The CoReACTER plans to hire **two doctoral students** in the Fall 2025 semester. One student will be working on **developing computational methods** to explore electrochemical reactivity using chemical reaction networks and multiscale modeling. The other student will be working on employing **high-throughput experiments** to design reactions for polymer recycling.

## Postdocs

We do not currently have funding for postdoctoral researchers, but interested candidates who currently hold external funding or are willing to pursue postdoctoral fellowships are always welcome to reach out. Some opportunities for postdoc fellowships are provided in our [resources page](/resources/).

## Undergraduates

The CoReACTER always welcomes undergraduate researchers! CMU students can perform research for credit. It may also be possible to obtain funding for undergraduate research (*e.g.*, through [HURAY](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/academic-research/huray/index.html)). **No prior research experience is required** to work in the CoReACTER, but a background in chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, or computer science may be helpful.

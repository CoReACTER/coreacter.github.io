The CoReACTER plans to hire two doctoral students in the Fall 2025 semester. One student will be working on developing computational methods to explore electrochemical reactivity using chemical reaction networks and multiscale modeling. The other student will be working on employing high-throughput experiments to design reactions for polymer recycling.

If you are interested in working on either of these projects, please reach out to [Prof. Spotte-Smith](mailto:ewcspottesmith@cmu.edu). In your e-mail, please provide a CV and explain:
1. What project(s) you are interested in working on
2. Why you are interested in this work, and in working in the CoReACTER

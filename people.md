# Interested in Joining?

Before you reach out or apply to work with us, it's a good idea for you to check out [The CoReACTER Manual](/_files/The_CoReACTER_Manual.pdf). If you like what you see and you feel aligned with our goals and philosophies, great! If you find yourself disagreeing with a lot of our core principles, this might not be a place where you want to devote your energy.

## Graduate Students

The CoReACTER (through EWCSS' role as a UCD Assistant Professor) is looking to sponsor one application for the [Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship Program](https://www.researchireland.ie/funding/government-ireland-postgraduate/). We are open to applicants in any research area in or related to chemistry. In particular, we welcome applicants with research interests related to chemical reaction networks (or network science more broadly), multiscale modeling, electrochemistry, sustainable chemistry, and/or philosophy of chemistry. Note that European Union (and adjacent) nationals/residents are preferred, but scholarships can be provided to applicants of any country of origin/residence.

See **Instructions** below for a brief outline of how to express your interest. Please reach out by **September 19, 2025**. We will interview candidates in the following week and plan to make our selection by **September 26** to ensure that the selected applicant has adequate time to prepare a strong application.

## Postdocs

The CoReACTER (through EWCSS' role as a UCD Assistant Professor) is looking to sponsor one application for the [Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://www.researchireland.ie/funding/government-ireland-postdoctoral/). We are open to applicants in any research area in or related to chemistry. In particular, we welcome applicants with research interests related to chemical reaction networks (or network science more broadly), multiscale modeling, electrochemistry, sustainable chemistry, and/or philosophy of chemistry.

## Undergraduates

The CoReACTER always welcomes undergraduate researchers! **No prior research experience is required** to work in the CoReACTER, but a background in chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, or computer science may be helpful.

**UCD**: There are some formal systems in place for UCD students to get research experience. You can receive [summer research placements](https://www.ucd.ie/mathstat/newsandevents/events/undergraduatesummerresearchproject/), though opportunities are limited. You can also work in the CoReACTER as part of your fourth-year research project. Of course, you can work with us even without this formal support, but we may not be able to compensate you (and we really don't support uncompensated labor)!

**CMU**: CMU students can also perform research for credit. It may also be possible to obtain funding for undergraduate research (*e.g.*, through [HURAY](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/academic-research/huray/index.html), [SURF](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer%20research%20fellowships/SURF/), or [ChESS](https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/education/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-research.html)). Note that, since EWCSS is an Adjunct Professor who is not physically located in Pittsburgh, collaboration with the CoReACTER may be more logistically challenging than working in other research groups.

## Instructions

If you are interested in working in the CoReACTER, please send an e-mail to [EWCSS](mailto:ewcspottesmith@cmu.edu). In your message, please provide a CV and answer the following questions:
1. What project(s) you are interested in working on?
2. Why you are interested in this work, and why are you interested in performing this work withnin the CoReACTER?
3. What is your least favorite word (in any language), and why?

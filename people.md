# Interested in Joining?

Before you reach out or apply to work with us, it's a good idea for you to check out [The CoReACTER Manual](/_files/The_CoReACTER_Manual.pdf). If you like what you see and you feel aligned with our goals and philosophies, great! If you find yourself disagreeing with a lot of our core principles, this might not be a place where you want to devote your energy.

## Graduate Students

The CoReACTER (through EWCSS' role as a UCD Assistant Professor) is looking to sponsor one application for the [Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship Program](https://www.researchireland.ie/funding/government-ireland-postgraduate/). We are open to applicants in any research area in or related to chemistry. In particular, we welcome applicants with research interests related to chemical reaction networks (or network science more broadly), multiscale modeling, electrochemistry, sustainable chemistry, and/or philosophy of chemistry. Note that European Union (and adjacent) nationals/residents are preferred, but scholarships can be provided to applicants of any country of origin/residence.

See **Instructions** below for a brief outline of how to express your interest. Please reach out by **September 19, 2025**. We will interview candidates in the following week and plan to make our selection by **September 26** to ensure that the selected applicant has adequate time to prepare a strong application.

We are also looking for one PhD student to work on a funded project based on Ad Astra Fellowship startup funding. This position would begin **January 1, 2026**. The aim of this project is to develop and apply computational methods for statistical learning on chemical reaction network (CRNs) structures. Of particular interests are (directed) hypergraph neural networks, which can be used to predict vertex (molecule), hyperedge (reaction), or hypergraph (network) features. While this project will be heavily focused on algorithm design and software development, especially in its early stages, we also intend to employ the methods developed for such applications as electrolyte decomposition in metal-ion batteries or biomass pyrolysis. One scholarship of stipend â‚¬25,000 per annum is available for 4 years for the successful applicant. Fees will be also covered. There will be a requirement to teach in undergraduate laboratories and tutorials as part of the scholarship.

The opening is listed on the [UCD vacancies page](https://www.ucd.ie/chem/vacancies/), and a full description (with job expectations and desired qualifications) is posted [here](https://www.ucd.ie/chem/t4media/Funded%20PhD%20with%20Assistant%20Professor%20Evan%20Spotte.pdf). See **Instructions** below for a brief outline of how to express your interest. Applications are due **October 31, 2025**. We will reach out with further details, including information related to (virtual) interviews, after the closing date.

## Postdocs

We do not currently have funding for postdoctoral researchers, but interested candidates who currently hold external funding or are willing to pursue postdoctoral fellowships are always welcome to reach out. Some opportunities for postdoc fellowships are provided in our [resources page](/resources/).

## Undergraduates

The CoReACTER always welcomes undergraduate researchers! **No prior research experience is required** to work in the CoReACTER, but a background in chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, or computer science may be helpful.

**UCD**: There are some formal systems in place for UCD students to get research experience. You can receive [summer research placements](https://www.ucd.ie/mathstat/newsandevents/events/undergraduatesummerresearchproject/), though opportunities are limited. You can also work in the CoReACTER as part of your fourth-year research project. Of course, you can work with us even without this formal support, but we may not be able to compensate you (and we really don't support uncompensated labor)!

**CMU**: CMU students can also perform research for credit. It may also be possible to obtain funding for undergraduate research (*e.g.*, through [HURAY](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/academic-research/huray/index.html), [SURF](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer%20research%20fellowships/SURF/), or [ChESS](https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/education/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-research.html)). Note that, since EWCSS is an Adjunct Professor who is not physically located in Pittsburgh, collaboration with the CoReACTER may be more logistically challenging than working in other research groups.

## Instructions

If you are interested in working in the CoReACTER, please send an e-mail to [EWCSS](mailto:ewcspottesmith@cmu.edu). In your message, please provide a CV and answer the following questions:
1. What project(s) you are interested in working on?
2. Why you are interested in this work, and why are you interested in performing this work within the CoReACTER?
3. What is your least favorite word (in any language), and why?

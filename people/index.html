If you like what you see and you feel aligned with our goals and philosophies, great&#33; If you find yourself disagreeing with a lot of our core principles, this might not be a place where you want to devote your energy.</p> <h2 id=graduate_students ><a href="#graduate_students" class=header-anchor >Graduate Students</a></h2> <p>The CoReACTER plans to hire <strong>one doctoral student</strong> at UCD with a start date of January 2026. Stay tuned for more details&#33;</p> <h2 id=postdocs ><a href="#postdocs" class=header-anchor >Postdocs</a></h2> <p>We do not currently have funding for postdoctoral researchers, but interested candidates who currently hold external funding or are willing to pursue postdoctoral fellowships are always welcome to reach out. Some opportunities for postdoc fellowships are provided in our <a href="/resources/">resources page</a>.</p> <h2 id=undergraduates ><a href="#undergraduates" class=header-anchor >Undergraduates</a></h2> <p>The CoReACTER always welcomes undergraduate researchers&#33; <strong>No prior research experience is required</strong> to work in the CoReACTER, but a background in chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, or computer science may be helpful.</p> <p><strong>UCD</strong>: There are some formal systems in place for UCD students to get research experience. You can receive <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/mathstat/newsandevents/events/undergraduatesummerresearchproject/">summer research placements</a>, though opportunities are limited. You can also work in the CoReACTER as part of your fourth-year research project. Of course, you can work with us even without this formal support, but we may not be able to compensate you &#40;and we really don&#39;t support uncompensated labor&#41;&#33;</p> <p><strong>CMU</strong>: CMU students can also perform research for credit. It may also be possible to obtain funding for undergraduate research &#40;<em>e.g.</em>, through <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/uro/academic-research/huray/index.html">HURAY</a>, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer&#37;20research&#37;20fellowships/SURF/">SURF</a>, or <a href="https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/education/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-research.html">ChESS</a>&#41;. Note that, since EWCSS is an Adjunct Professor who is not physically located in Pittsburgh, collaboration with the CoReACTER may be more logistically challenging than working in other research groups.</p> <h2 id=instructions ><a href="#instructions" class=header-anchor >Instructions</a></h2> <p>If you are interested in working in the CoReACTER, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:ewcspottesmith@cmu.edu">EWCSS</a>.

We leverage developments in <strong>mathematics, computational chemistry, and data science</strong> to advance sustainable technologies in areas such as <strong>energy storage, chemical manufacturing, and waste management</strong>. We also study scientific and chemical ethics and work to improve chemical education. You can learn more about our research efforts <a href="/research/">here</a> or look at our <a href="/publications/">publications</a>.</p> <p>The CoReACTER is working hard to practice science in an <strong>ethical, thoughtful, and anti-oppressive</strong> fashion. This is an ongoing process, but you can read about our current thoughts and practices <a href="/philosophy/principles">here</a>. Our <a href="/resources/">resources</a> are mainly designed for <a href="/people/">ReACTERs</a> and other folks currently working and conducting research at CMU &#40;UCD-specific resources are coming&#33;&#41;, but you may also find these helpful&#33;</p> <h1 id=land_acknowledgment ><a href="#land_acknowledgment" class=header-anchor >Land Acknowledgment</a></h1> <p>We acknowledge that CMU occupies the unceded lands of the Seneca &#40;Haudenosaunee&#41;, Adena, Hopewell, Monongahela, Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Lenape peoples, in what is now known as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States of America. We recognize that we benefit from this unjust occupation, the colonization of this region, and the concomitant displacement and elimination of Native peoples. We strive to enter into respectful relationships with the peoples of these lands and with the lands themselves as we search for avenues for healing, justice, and reconciliation.</p> <h1 id=news ><a href="#news" class=header-anchor >News</a></h1> <table class=newstab  style="border:0;"> <colgroup> <col width="20%" /> <col width="80%" /> <thead> <tr> <td> <em>Sep 19, 2025</em> <td> <p>The UCD School of Chemistry wrote <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/chem/newsevents/threenewadastrafellowsjointheschool/">an article</a> introducing EWCSS to the school community.

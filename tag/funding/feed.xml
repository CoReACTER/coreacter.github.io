<h2 id="our_approach_to_funding">Our Approach to Funding</h2>
<p>The CoReACTER needs to maintain sufficient funding to continue operation. The funding process is morally fraught, and there are very few options for sustainable research funding that do not require some kind of ethical compromise. Understanding this, we are generally open to any funding source, though we try to move towards funding sources that are as aligned with our <a href="https://coreacter.org/philosophy/principles">principles</a> as possible.</p>
<p>There are, however, some areas that we will not consider because they are radically opposed to our principles, the good of the scientific community, and/or the wellbeing of society. The CoReACTER will not pursue or accept funding or other resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>From military sources &#40;<em>e.g.</em>, the United States Department of Defense&#41;, organizations whose major product or service relates to military technologies &#40;<em>i.e.</em>, members of the military-industrial complex&#41;, or from projects with direct military applications</p>
</li>
<li><p>For projects that will further the extraction and utilization of fossil fuels, or that otherwise are likely to significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions and/or accelerate anthropogenic climate change</p>
</li>
<li><p>That impede us from sharing our finding freely and openly, or that limit our ability to effectively collaborate</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We note that &quot;other resources&quot; includes computational resources. This means that we will not, for instance, pursue access to or access supercomputers owned and operated by the Department of Defense.</p>

			<strong>Project</strong>: Direct Introduction of Competition and Kinetics to Materials Mechanism and Reaction Network Prediction<br>
			<strong>Description</strong>: Solid-state synthesis continues to be driven by trial-and-error experimentation, with no coherent design rules or underlying theory. Though there has been considerable interest in predicting the outcomes of solid-state reactions and automating the selection of precursors and synthesis conditions, most approaches developed to date rely entirely on bulk thermodynamics, ignoring the kinetics of nucleation and growth. Our proposed work provides a new approach for predictive materials synthesis, combining machine learning, molecular dynamics simulations, and chemical reaction networks to calculate solid-state reaction kinetics, rationally explain synthesis outcomes, and select precursors that are likely to lead to efficient formation of desired product phases.

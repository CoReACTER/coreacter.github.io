As practitioners of science and engineering, we are responsible for clearly communicating our findings to our scientific peers. We also value our role in sharing information with the public and the press, and in teaching and training junior researchers. This blog is part of our efforts to meet these responsibilities&#33;</p> <p>Every post here has been written by ReACTERs, discussed in a CoReACTER group organizational meeting, and approved through a collective decision-making process. This does <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> mean that each post reflects the views of each individual ReACTER, and in general, only the authors of a post and the CoReACTER as an organization should be held responsible for the views espoused in a given post.</p> <p>In general, we will not take down a post once it has been edited and approved, as we would not want to pretend that our mistakes had not happened. Exceptions would include if, for instance, we had posted information without appropriate permissions or consent. If we find that we have made incorrect or harmful statements, we reserve the right to edit posts &#40;clearly indicating where edits have been made and why they were made&#41;, and in serious cases we may make further posts apologizing for improper statements or explaining how our views have evolved. These guidelines are part of our practices of accountability.</p> <h2 id=posts ><a href="#posts" class=header-anchor >Posts</a></h2> <table class=blogtab  style="border:0;"> <colgroup> <col width="40%" /> <col width="60%" /> <thead> <tr> <td> <div class=blog_preview_image ><img src="/_files/images/20250530_leaving_before_the_beginning/leaving_cmu_ucd_toc.png" class=blog_preview_image  alt="The presidential seal of Carnegie Mellon University (a stylized gold thistle in front of a tartan background, with the words 'Carnegie Mellon University' and 'Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 1900' in a surrounding circle) and, to the right, the seal of University College Dublin (a blue and green shield with three castles - each topped by flames; the words 'UCD Dublin'; and a gold harp)."></div> <td> <h2><a href="/posts/20250530_leaving_before_the_beginning">Leaving Before the Beginning</a></h2><br> <p><em>Evan Walter Clark Spotte-Smith (EWCSS) (they/them)</em><br> Posted on: May 30, 2025<br> In response to the rise of fascism in the United States, EWCSS is leaving for University College Dublin in Ireland.
